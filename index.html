            <p>           Ensure your fish are happy and healthy by keeping their tank clean and properly filled with water.  Mix a saltwater solution. It's essential that the temperature, salinity, and pH of the water are all within an acceptable range for your fish. Start this process the night before you clean your tank.  n some cases, such as if you have corals in your tank, you may need to mix the salt to seawater concentration which is 35 g/L.  Check the temperature with a thermometer. For saltwater fish, it should be between 73–82 °F (23–28 °C).
